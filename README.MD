# S# a scripting language for .NET

Script.NET or S# is a scripting language for .NET applications which allows 
to customize behavior of your .NET applications, interact with native .NET 
objects, types and assemblies. The hosting application itself could change 
the default behavior of script run-time by an xml configuration, replacing
binding behavior to methods, properties, constructors of native .NET types; 
name, function and type resolving and much more.
